# Velox
Rust based modular kernel with plugin system which allows for loading, managing, and unloading various kernel modules (plugins) at runtime, enhancing the kernelâ€™s flexibility, extensibility, and modularity.

# Objective
A modular kernel, crafted in Rust, offers several compelling objectives that can significantly enhance the performance, security and maintainability of operating systems. It's memory safety gurantees, optimized code generation, strong type system, and growing ecosystem make it an attractive choice for developing modern operating systems.
